Welcome to my little corner of the web! This site is a personal project where I
get AI to explore and present insights on the intersection of AI and clinical
trials. A custom AI framework builds a collection of overviews on this topic,
with new posts coming out monthly. The main source of information is ArXiv, so
you'll find that the content here is usually fresh off the press. > I want to be
VERY transparent about the content here. **The posts are 100% AI-generated**
(that is kind of the point of the site), and I don't always get a chance to
review them thoroughly before they go live. **Disclaimer** > > Please be aware
that mistakes can and do happen. Always verify the information presented here
before citing or using it in your own work.
