## About This Project

Hey, thanks for stopping by! This website is a personal project that I started to make sense of the rapidly evolving world of AI in clinical trials. 

Speaking of AI, couln't it find and digest the loads of interesting research on this field? Shouldn't I be able to dedicate my time to the few papers I consider truly interesting? 

The monthly newsletters you'll find here is my attempt to get AI to do exactly that.

> I want to be **VERY** transparent about the content here. The posts are 100% AI-generated (that is kind of the point of the site), and I don't always get a chance to review them thoroughly before they go live.

### Why I Built This

You might be wondering why I decided to build my own little framework for this instead of using some of the powerful, off-the-shelf research tools out there. While those tools are fantastic, I wanted to have a more hands-on approach. I like to be in control of where the information comes from, how it's selected, and how it's ultimately presented.

This started as a personal tool to test the limits of AI systems for scientific research (and streamline my own literature research while doing so!). However, a few friends and colleagues found the summaries useful, so I thought, "Why not share them online?"

### The Nitty-Gritty

If you're curious about the technical side of things, there are no big secrets. It's a custom-built system that helps me gather and summarize information. I'm not quite ready to share the code as it's a bit of a work in progress, but I'm more than happy to chat about it. Feel free to reach out if you are curious!

I hope you find the content here interesting and useful!
